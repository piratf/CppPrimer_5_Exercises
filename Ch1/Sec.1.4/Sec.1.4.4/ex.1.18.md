Q: Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is repeated.

---

A:
The program's output like this when I'm giving it only equal values:
![equal values][equal values]

and the output like this when I'm giving it only equal values:
![different values][different values]

[equal values]:./ex.1.18.1.PNG
[different values]:./ex.1.18.2.PNG
