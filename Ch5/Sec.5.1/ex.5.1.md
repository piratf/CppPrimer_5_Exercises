Q: What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

---

A: a null statement is a single semicolon or an empty block.

I will use null statement in a `for` loop if I want to write a loop running forever only if I take the initiative to jump out, or use in the `while` loop to do nothing in the loop.
