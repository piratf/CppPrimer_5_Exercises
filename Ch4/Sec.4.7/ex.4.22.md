Q: Extend the program that assigned `high pass`, `pass`, and `fail` grades to also assign low pass for grades between `60` and `75` includive. Write two versions: One version that uses only conditional operators; the other should use one or more `if` statements. Which version do you think is easier to understand and why?

A: I prefer the conditional one when the expression was not too complicated, although it more easy to get error and need lots of parenthese to ensure the right evaluation order, but this way was `light` to read if using good format like my code. The `if` statement need more typing when write long expressions.

When the expression goes more complicated and need more steps, I will use `if` statement to get the code clearly enough.

Codes in file `ex.4.22.cpp`, using data in `ex.4.22.data`.
