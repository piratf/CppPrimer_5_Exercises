Q: The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators. Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions? Rewrite the program using postfix operators.

---

A: Because of the process order of `for` loop, the prefix or postfix increment operator makes no difference.

So don't need any change.
