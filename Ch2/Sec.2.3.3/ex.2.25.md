Q: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

    (a) int* ip, i, &r = i;     (b) int i, *ip = 0;     (c) int *ip, ip2;

---

A: 

    (a) int* ip, i, &r = i; // ip is a int type pointer, value is undefined. i is a int object, value is undefined, r is a int reference, initial with object i.  
    (b) int i, *ip = 0;     // i is a int object, value is undefined, ip is a int pointer, with value 0 initialized.
    (c) int *ip, ip2;       // ip is a int pointer with undefined value, ip2 is a int object.
