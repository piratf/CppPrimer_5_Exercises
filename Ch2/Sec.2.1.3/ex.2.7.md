Q: What values do these literals represent? What type does each have?

    (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"
    (b) 3.14e1L     (c) 1024f   (d) 3.14L

A:
> + (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" represent a string like this:

    "Who goes with Fergus?"
> + (b) 3.14e1L represent a long double which value equal to 31.4

> + (c) 1024f means a float type number which value equal to 1024.0

    (but it could be wrong in some implement)> + (d) 3.14L is a long double number 3.14
