A: 
    
> + (a) int double = 3.14;   

invalid, double is c++ reversed keyword
> + (b) int _;               

ok, but not recommend, it can't indication its meaning.
> + (b) int catch-22;        

invalid, only letters, numbers and underscore character. 
> + (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;      

invalid, can't start with a number.
> + (e) double Double = 3.14;

ok.
