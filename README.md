Some problems need a answer, I wrote them in `.md` file. This file could open in most of editor.
Some need to write code, I wrote them in `.cpp` file. use `.txt` file which have same filename with the code file as the input.
Normally, I record problem contents at the first line of both answer file and code file. Sometimes problems need both answer file and code file, I record the problem contents in the `.md` file, and write code in the `.cpp` file, so in this situation, read `.md` file first.
